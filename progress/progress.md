# This file contains my progress over time. 

## Day 1: November 9th
#### Task1: 
    Writing a script for data loading.

#### Task2: 
    Figuring out the methodologies to perform the pre-processing. 

## Day 2: November 10th
#### Notes:
    1. Worked on converting the text file to csv for easing things out. 
    2. Writing data loader function for video frame extraction for implementing CNN. 


## Day 3: November 26
#### Notes
    1. implemented a 3 layer CNN and passing the 10000 images from each class. Evaluation metrics are perfect and on the point. 

## Day 4: November 27
#### Notes
    1. Implemented lazy data loading. 

## December 3rd,4th, and 5th
#### Notes
    1. Studied about 3D CNN
    2. Referred tensorflow code and tried to implement it on the custom dataset
    3. Worked on dataloading methods, implemented on the air data loading method
    4. There is a progress on the implementation. 
    5. First run - train acc: 0.88, val acc: 0.90, test acc: 0.29 
    Future work: implementing auxiliary features and passing it to the model.
